Added a break statement which fixed a bug where hero would slow down too much if he tried
to drag a dead body when more than one dead body was around.
Changed click listener to on mouse down for more responsive shooting

major: PATHFINDING
minor: made screen bigger
increase sprite speed
new map for pathing
commented out guard agro to test path finding
guards now move only when they have a path
when hero shoots gun, path is created from guards to hero and they go to where they 
heard the shot.

//
guards can become alerted, and stop moving when they see you.
bug: fixed a weird issue when walking into a guard who notices you sets hero back to 0,0.  This must have something to do with javascript.
  I called guards[i].target = hero; rather than guards[i].target = {x: hero.x, y: hero.y}; I think target became a pointer for hero and then
   target.x and .y got set to null or 0 or something.
Guards rotate to follow hero with sight.
Sprites rotate to face target.
