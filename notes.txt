Added a break statement which fixed a bug where hero would slow down too much if he tried
to drag a dead body when more than one dead body was around.
Changed click listener to on mouse down for more responsive shooting

major: PATHFINDING
minor: made screen bigger
increase sprite speed
new map for pathing
commented out guard agro to test path finding
guards now move only when they have a path
when hero shoots gun, path is created from guards to hero and they go to where they 
heard the shot.
